We propose a framework for **global-scale canopy height estimation** based on satellite data. Our model leverages advanced data preprocessing techniques, resorts to a novel loss function designed to counter geolocation inaccuracies inherent in the ground-truth height measurements, and employs data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission to effectively filter out erroneous labels in mountainous regions, enhancing the reliability of our predictions in those areas. A comparison between predictions and ground-truth labels yields an MAE / RMSE of 2.43 / 4.73 (meters) overall and 4.45 / 6.72 (meters) for trees taller than five meters, which depicts a substantial improvement compared to existing global-scale maps. The resulting height map as well as the underlying framework will facilitate and enhance ecological analyses at a global scale, including, but not limited to, large-scale forest and biomass monitoring.

A comparison between our map and two other existing global height maps (Lang et al., Potapov et al.), as well as a regional map for France reveals that the visual quality improved a lot. It closely matches the one from regional maps, albeit some regions with remaining quality differences (e.g. column 8)

## Interactive Google Earth Engine viewer
We uploaded our produced canopy height map to Google Earth Engine and created a [GEE app](https://worldwidemap.projects.earthengine.app/view/canopy-height-2020) that allows users to visualize our map globally and compare it to other existing products. If you want to build your own app or download/use our map in another way, you can access the map under the following asset_id:

```
var canopy_height_2020 = ee.ImageCollection('projects/worldwidemap/assets/canopyheight2020')

# To display on the map, create the mosaic:
var canopy_height_2020 = ee.ImageCollection('projects/worldwidemap/assets/canopyheight2020').mosaic()
```
